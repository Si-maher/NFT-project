## My process

At first I was planning to use Sass but then I thought that because it was a small project, CSS with some Utility classes would suffice. Once I had the initial classes in the HTML, I ended up deleting a few as I was failing to adhere to the 'Do not repeat yourself' philosophy. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
 
It is tempting, even with small projects to write as much code as possible, to unnecessarily over complicate the project. More code does translate into a better App or project.

I also became a little stuck on the hover state regarding the hero-image. It took a while and a little research to figure out that making an overlay component would be a viable solution. One to remember for future projects!

### Continued development

Onwards and upwards to the next project.
